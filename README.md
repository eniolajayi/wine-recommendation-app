# Wine Recommendation App

A React-based application that uses the Spoonacular API to recommend wine based on a particular category or food pairing. The frontend uses Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- A Spoonacular API key (sign up for a free API key at spoonacular.com)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/wine-recommendation-app.git
```

2. Install the dependencies
```bash
cd wine-recommendation-app
npm install
```

3. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project and add the following line, replacing    `SPOONACULAR_API_KEY` with your actual API key:
```makefile
REACT_APP_SPOONACULAR_API_KEY=YOUR_SPOONACULAR_API_KEY
```
Start the development server
```bash
npm start
```

The app will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5173/.
